        </div>
        <p class="editorial-body parallax-text"><span class="drop-cap">A</span>Iceberg Mind was born from a simple belief: that intelligence is not a race to the top, but a <strong>journey below the surface</strong>. In a world flooded with fast content and noisy knowledge, we wanted to create something different.</p>

            <p class="editorial-body">We don't claim expertise in psychology or nervous system science. What we claim is <strong>curiosity</strong> in <strong>subconscious rewiring</strong>, craftsmanship, and care.</p>

            <p class="editorial-body">We see content not as a product, but as a <strong>living experience</strong> — one that can play, teach, surprise, and empower. We create <strong>digital objects</strong>: some playful, some poetic, some purely practical.</p>

            <p class="editorial-body">We are designers, makers, researchers, and parents — trying to shape tools that <strong>spark ideas</strong>, facilitate creation, or gently <strong>awaken minds</strong>.</p>

            <p class="editorial-body">Some of our content is designed for children. Some for adults. Some for both. But all of it is guided by the same principle: <strong>explore below the surface</strong>. Education is not always the goal — but it's often the side effect. And so is <strong>joy</strong>.</p>

            <p class="editorial-body">Inspired by the iceberg, our craft is layered: <strong>playful on the surface</strong>, <strong>rooted in research below</strong>. We use AI to enhance form and interaction, but never to replace thought.</p>

            <p class="editorial-body">Our vision begins in <strong>early childhood</strong>, where so much is silently shaped — but it doesn't end there. It reaches the child within us all, the parents who guide, the educators who nurture, and the minds that still wonder.</p>

            <p class="editorial-body"><em>AIceberg Mind is not an answer. It's a question: what kind of world do we create when we shape content from the depth of human potential?</em></p>
